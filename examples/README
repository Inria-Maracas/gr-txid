# Important files for scenario definition

## scheduler
Defines the order of packets sent.
Only the nodes present in node_list will send packets.
If a node is present in the list but not actually active, everything will work fine, except that it will take longer to send the same amount of packets: the time slots occupied by that node will not be used by another.

## scenario_src
Base scenario file that will be modified by the createFolderAndFiles_usrp.py script.
Used to define the run time of one experiment, afecting the amont of samples gathered.
And also, by changing the arguments to the emitter commands sent to the nodes, define the type of data sent: Static, random or noise, Plain or Varying.


## createFolderAndFiles_usrp
Takes all the source files and generate task folders ready to be submitted to FIT/CorteXlab.
Works over the list of involved nodes and replaces the command of the one chosen to be receiver by the proper command.
The string line 28 needs to match the commands of the scenrario_src file.


## generateData
Bash script for creating the tasks, submitting them, waiting for them to end and dezipping the relevant result files in a proper folder.
